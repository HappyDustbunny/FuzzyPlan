# FuzzyPlan
FuzzyPlan is a planning tool for those of us who hates plans and structure - but knows we need both.

It is hard to structure your day if you struggle with keeping all tasks and priorities in your head at the same time.

You could write them down, but writing them down makes rearranging tasks cumbersome, both on paper and in traditional calendars.

FuzzyPlan tries to address this by making tasks easily swappable and by making entering tasks at a given time and of a given length a breeze.

The green add-task button (+) helps you get started by providing a fairly traditional calendar interface, but the idea is to learn a few shorthand ways to quickly enter tasks.

Tasks can be swapped just by tapping them, and tasks can be edited by double tapping.

Templates helps you schedule around reccuring tasks and the Month View let you plan tasks in the future - and be reminded to put these tasks into the relevant day. Past days is stored to help you evaluate how you spend you days, and recurring tasks can be colour coded.

FuzzyPlan also feature a basic stress model (with healtbar!) to remind you to take breaks and not be overly ambitious planning your day.

FuzzyPlan is free to use and ALL data is stored on your phone/computer. No data is collected by me. 

I can't guarantee everything works and that you will be reminded as planned, so have important stuff in a traditional calendar with alarms too.
